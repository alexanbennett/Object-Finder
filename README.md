# KF5042 Alexander Bennett w21005417 MATLAB Code
This MATLAB code utalises the computer vision toolbox within MATLABS. It finds an object within an image by utalising the images features, and finding similarities within the images.

Steps to execute my code:
  1. import an reference image of the object you wish to find in a scene. Save this image to variable 'objectFindColour'.
  2. Import an image of the scene of which the object is within. Save this image to variable 'objectInSceneColour'.
  3. Run the code. 
  4. The code will show its steps in finding the object, generating diagrams during runtime.
  5. Ultimately, if the code found the object, the object with be shown in the scene with a box around the object.

DEPENDENCIES:
MATLAB Computer Vision Toolbox Version 10+
